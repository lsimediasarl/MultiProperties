# MultiProperties
Netbeans implementation of the very useful eclipse plugin "Multiproperties" by Kriszti√°n Zsolt Sallai.

The original eclipse plugin can be found here [Multiproperties eclipse plugin](https://github.com/skazsi/multiproperties)

The files written by the eclipse plugin (*.multiproperties) can be edited under
netbeans using this plugin.

## Release
This plugin is written from scratch, no code sharing with the original plugin.

Not every feature of the original plugin is implemented.

## Features
Some features not found in the original are implemented

- Possibility to lock down some lines (read only)
- Merge of two multiproperties file

## Compatibility with Eclipse plugin
The netbeans generated files (*.multiproperties) are compatible with the one
generated by the Eclipe plugin, but there are some limitation:

- Only the "Java Properties" and "Android" handlers are supported
- The relative path are not supported by the eclipse plugin (if you save the
  java handler with a relative path to the .multiproperties file with netbeans,
  Eclipse cannot handle it)
- Additional meta data (like if a field cannot be modified in lockdown mode) is
  lost when opened with eclipse (file format 1.3 is the version specific to
  netbeans)

## Standalone application

A stand alone version is also available which permits for non developer to start
an application and save the multiproperties files.

The standalone version implements the concept of "Session", which is a group of opened
files, so it's easy to switch from a group of file to another group of files.

## Todos

- Update eclipse plugin to implement the relative path (to the .multiproperties file)
  for handled save files
- Update eclipse plugin to implement additional meta-data (field cannot be changed
  if in lockdown mode)

## Utils

A ResourceBundle implementation is available to directly use the multiproperties
file for localization.

Example

    ResourceBundle bundle = ResourceBundle.getBundle("lsimedia/multiproperties/utils/ml", new Locale("fr"), MultiPropertiesResourceBundleControl.Control);  
    String key = bundle.getString("word_yes");
